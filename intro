Here's how it works:

There are several types of questions.  Within the main menu you can choose what type of question you want to answer.  To select an option, press the number associated to that option and hit enter.  At any time you can type 'help' and hit enter to see clarifying text.

Once you select a type of question, you will be given questions of that type until you type 'exit.'  To give up on a problem, type 'pass.' You are encouraged to pass relatively rarely. For reference, I pass when a problem looks like it will take more than 3-4 minutes. For good scientific hygiene, don't type "exit" if you see a question and don't like it. Instead, answer (or give up on) one last question after deciding to quit.

If you choose the question type 'Medley' you will receive a balanced mix of questions. The distribution is chosen such that you spend an equal amount of time on each problem type. From the main menu you can also fill out a survey including information like your recent sleep history. (If you don't like filling out particular questions in the survey, enter 'none' or similar. Fields left blank default to the last value you entered.)

[Press Enter to continue]


After this you will enter a username which will be used to identify you. Everything you type (together with timing information) will be recorded and sent to the server. Most questions you answer will have already been answered by someone else; information about different participant's accuracy and speed on a particular question are used to control for random variation in the difficulty of problems.
